# Generative adversarial networks for the design of acoustic metamaterials (metaGAN)

Metamaterials are attracting increasing interest in the field of acoustics due to their sound insulation effects. By periodically arranged structures, acoustic metamaterials can influence the way how sound propogates in acoustic media. To date, the design of acoustic metamaterials relies primarily on the expertise of specialists since most effects are based on localized solutions and interference. This paper outlines a deep learning based approach to extend current knowledge of metamaterial design in acoustics. We develop a design method by using conditional generative adversarial networks. The generative network proposes a cell candidate regarding a desired transmission behavior of the metamaterial. In order to validate our method, numerical simulations with the finite element method are performed. Our study reveals considerable insight into design strategies for sound insulation tasks. By providing design directives for acoustic metamaterials, cell candidates can be inspected and tailored to achieve desirable transmission characteristics.
